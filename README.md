# Browser-Native Web Accessibility

20% of the world's population has some form of disability. But this talk isn't about disabilities -- this talk is about Accessibility. What if you want to watch a video without sound? What if you want to browse images in a text-only browser? What if you want a web page read aloud to you? What if you want to maximize your potential SEO using only the baked-in capabilities of your web browser? 

In this talk, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) gives simple, practical examples of the Accessibility features that are already available in HTML. You'll add text-to-speech in two lines of JavaScript. You'll trivially add subtitles to audio and video using the track element and a plain-text WebVTT file. You'll make all of your web page elements -- not just the text -- SEO friendly. Oh, and remember that 20% of your user base that I mentioned earlier? Yeah, you'll ensure that they aren't excluded from your shopping cart and your profit margin.
